## Key Components

### 1. Navigation (Navbar)
- Located in `src/components/Navbar.js`
- Responsive navigation bar with mobile menu
- Dynamic links based on authentication state
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### 2. Hero Section
- Located in `src/components/Hero.js`
- Features three alternating animated backgrounds:
  1. Neural Network: Animated nodes and connections
  2. Grid Pattern: Rotating grid with scale transformations
  3. Particles: Floating particles with layered animations
- Backgrounds rotate every 30 seconds
- Responsive text and button layout

### 3. Footer
- Located in `src/components/Footer.js`
- Centralized design with essential links
- Copyright information
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

### 4. Authentication Components
- Login (`src/components/Login.js`)
- Signup (`src/components/Signup.js`)
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Integration with authentication context

### 5. Under Construction Page
- Located in `src/components/UnderConstruction.js`
- Displayed after successful login
- Features animated AI background
- Thank you message with user's email

## Authentication

The website uses React Context API for authentication management:

```javascript
// Example of protected route implementation
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children }) => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  
  return children;
};
```

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS Integration
- Utility-first approach for consistent styling
- Custom configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoint system

### Custom CSS
- Component-specific styles in separate CSS files
- Animation definitions
- Custom color schemes and gradients

Example of animation CSS:
```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 0.6;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.5);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

## Animations

### Background Animations
The website features several sophisticated animations:

1. **Neural Network**
   - Pulsing nodes
   - Connecting lines with fade effects
   - Random positioning and timing

2. **Grid Pattern**
   - Rotating grid lines
   - Scale transformations
   - Continuous movement

3. **Particles**
   - Multiple layers of floating particles
   - Different sizes and opacities
   - Smooth transitions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Component Creation**
   - Create new components in `src/components/`
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Follow the existing naming conventions

2. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes when possible
   - Create separate CSS files for complex animations
   - Maintain responsive design principles

3. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Keep component state local when possible
   - Implement proper error handling

4. **Routing**
   - Add new routes in `App.js`
   - Protect sensitive routes using `ProtectedRoute`
   - Maintain consistent navigation patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components focused and single-responsibility
   - Use meaningful component and variable names
   - Comment complex logic and animations

2. **Performance**
   - Implement lazy loading for routes
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Use React.memo() for expensive computations

3. **Security**
   - Protect sensitive routes
   - Validate user input
   - Handle authentication properly

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Check Context Provider wrapping
   - Verify route protection
   - Clear browser storage if needed

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Reduce animation complexity on mobile
   - Use transform instead of position properties
   - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect

3. **Styling Conflicts**
   - Check Tailwind class specificity
   - Verify CSS import order
   - Use proper CSS scoping

## Deployment

The website can be deployed using various platforms:

1. **Build Process**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deployment Platforms**
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - AWS Amplify
   - GitHub Pages

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep packages updated
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Test after major updates

2. **Testing**
   - Verify all routes and functionality
   - Test on different devices and browsers
   - Check animation performance

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track user interactions
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check performance metrics
